# flip-paper-template
A LaTeX paper template that I use for papers and notes.

By Flip Tanedo (flip.tanedo@ucr.edu)

Uses Jacques Distler's `utcaps.bst` and AAS TeX's `aas_macros.sty`, included in this repository. 

## How to use this

For those, like me, are less competent with `git` and GitHub than we really aught to be.

1. Go to repo's [page](https://github.com/fliptanedo/flip-paper-template) on GitHub.
