%%%  ABSTRACT    %%%%

\begin{abstract}
\noindent 
This is a simple template for my papers. It's not very different from the plain article style, but it has most of the macros I use pre-written.
\end{abstract}




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%  THE MEAT    %%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Use \input if you have separate files.
% \include is `smarter' (creates separate aux files for each tex file) 
% and hence more efficient, but it automatically puts a page break
% between included files. Input doesn't do this.


\section{Introduction}

In the beginning...


\section{Note on External TikZ Diagrams}

 This is a bit cumbersome, so I'll leave it commented out by default
 Usage: create the subdirectory tikz (or whatever ``prefix'' you use in
 the \texttt{tikzexternalize} option). Make sure the \texttt{-shell-escape} 
 is used when you compile. 
 %
 For Texpad this is a checkbox in the typesetting preferences.
 Tikz pictures will be exported as PDFs in the tikz directory.

 Note: this is NOT perfect! Some diagrams come out wonky, especially if you
 use arrows (e.g. for Feynman diagrams) or if you put the Tikz pictures in
 odd places (like in equation environments). What it does buy you is a HUGE
 improvement in compile time. I suggest using this for intermediate 
 typesets in a large document. For the final compile just turn it off again
 so you get clean graphics.
 
\section{Itemize test}

\begin{itemize}% \itemsep1pt \parskip0pt \parsep0pt
\item Item 1
\item Item 2
\item Item 3
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}% \itemsep1pt \parskip0pt \parsep0pt
\item Item 1
\item Item 2
\item Item 3
\end{enumerate}


 
\section{lipsum}
 
 \lipsum[3-5]


\section{XeLaTeX}

XeLaTeX lets you access local system fonts for use in \LaTeX. It's great for Beamer, but I don't recommend it in a regular paper. It doesn't play well with some useful macros like `blackboard math,' \url{http://tinyurl.com/a28hrle}.
